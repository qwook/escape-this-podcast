  <h1>The Art Studio</h1>
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>Thank you so much to Anna Engelke and Josquin Desprez, our Patreon donors
    whose names were given to the characters in this room!
  </p>
  <p>
    This room is probably the one I’d call most doable for a single player out of all recent
    episodes. But I’ve been wrong before, so who knows? Playing with two is usually more
    fun, anyway.
  </p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    You really don’t want to spend your afternoon on some extra credit assignment, but
    when you’re barely pulling a C+ in physics and your parents are very, very aware of
    that fact, you don’t have much choice. So you head on over to the address Doc Bill
    gave you and enter his not-so-secret lab.
  </p>
  <p>
    Inside, you see an array of all the top students from your class, along with a couple
    of the okay ones. You narrow your eyes. Is this really an extra credit assignment?
    When you ask this, your classmates all give each other sidelong glances. That’s a big
    no. You turn to the most trustworthy one and demand to know what’s actually going
    on, but Doc Bill interrupts with exasperation.
  </p>
  <p>
    “It’s time travel! We need you to go back in time and fix my assistant’s misdeeds! I’ve
    explained this too many times now, everyone else here is getting sick of it. Just put
    on this special science watch and get in the machine.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Yeah… you turn back to the other students. And they all nod to confirm, that’s
    basically the whole story. Okay, you have to go back some unknown amount of time,
    to some unknown place, to fix some unknown problem caused by some unknown
    assistant. Sure, nothing wrong with that. But your classmates all seem pretty
    cheerful about this whole arrangement, so how bad could it possibly be? Maybe
    travelling through time gives you some amazing new appreciation for your own life,
    or something cliché like that.
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, Doc Bill ushers you towards the big machine against the wall. “My computer
    readout tells me the consequences of Greg’s actions, and this time, it says that some
    famous work that was supposed to have been done has been erased from the
    timeline. He didn’t destroy it; whatever it was, it was never made. Like if Chuck Berry
    had never created Johnny B. Goode, if he’d never found that ‘new sound’ he was
    looking for. You need to go back and find out why!”
  </p>
  <p>
    You don’t get time to ask another question as he slams his hand on a button and the
    machine roars to life, shaking and moving all the molecules in your body. When your
    head stops spinning, you realise you’re no longer in the lab. You’re in a brightly lit,
    brightly coloured basement – and there are two people in here with you! Quickly you
    duck behind the nearest object, a table, and hope for the best. Fortunately (question
    mark), the two of them, a man and a woman, seem to be deeply embroiled in a
    shouting match and haven’t noticed you in the slightest. You can’t understand most of
    what they’re saying because it sounds like very aggressive Spanish that’s way
    beyond anything you learned in school, but occasionally the man slips into other
    languages, including English. So you manage to catch a few key sentences from him:
  </p>
  <p>
    “It’s not working! The colour isn’t like last time! Why did she clean everything? She
    ruined everything! I cannot keep starting again! Burn it! Without the ingredients for
    my perfect new colour, this is nothing! I quit forever! The piece can finish itself!”
  </p>
  <p>
    The woman is mostly sighing impatiently and saying, “Josquin –” before being rudely
    spoken over, but even if you could hear her properly, you believe she’s only speaking
    Spanish. She gets in what sounds like one good riposte before Josquin yells one final
    thing, in French this time, and she grits her teeth and sits down. Josquin,
    meanwhile, storms up a set of stairs through a hatch in the ceiling, then slams it
    shut. You can still hear his shouts from the other side.
  </p>
  <p>
    Is this the Chuck Berry you’re supposed to be helping? Okay, you suppose not all
    creators can be the nicest people. You pop your head up and take a look at the room.
    It’s immediately clear that this is an art studio: in the centre of the room is a large
    wooden easel, and the table you hid behind, against the west wall, is covered in tubes
    of paint, a paint scraper, and a funny little machine. You’re surprised you didn’t
    notice the smell. The stairs are in the lower east corner, and there are two more
    smaller tables hugging the east wall, one with a bowl of fruit, and one with papers
    [‘copies’, in these notes]. You see a pile of canvases on the floor, and a violin case
    not far from them. Near the fruit table is a vase, and a long lounge chair sits to the
    north of the easel. And perched on that chair, sitting perfectly still, is the woman you
    heard earlier. She must be the artist’s poser. Her eyes are following you, so you’ve
    clearly been spotted, but she doesn’t seem to care. Maybe Josquin often has
    strangers hiding in his studio.
  </p>
  <p>
    Well… best figure out how to give this fiery guy his ‘new sound’ – er, his new colour.

    <observable-title>Canvases</observable-title>
    <observable-description>
      There are seven canvases, all medium-sized rectangles, smaller than the
      one currently on the easel. You wonder if they might be rejects. There’s
      something rather frail about them: they’re thin, even see-through in
      places. And now that you’re looking closely, it looks like Josquin did
      attempt to lightly sketch on them with his draft pencil before very
      quickly giving up. They appear to be sketches of a woman, perhaps his
      sitter before the current one, capturing her in the moment of biting
      into a piece of fruit. The fruit changes in each image, but she’s
      consistently biting into them. There’s one odd detail you notice,
      something in the background: each one has a small circle on it, in a
      different spot each time. A few are at the top, a couple near the
      middle, and a couple near the bottom. The thing is, the sketch is
      clearly supposed to be set in this basement, but you don’t see any
      circles anywhere near where he’s drawn them to
      be.

        <action-description>
          As it turns out, the small canvas and the large paper come out to
          be exactly the same size. They overlay perfectly, and with the
          thinness of the canvas, you can see the writing on the paper right
          through it. The circle on the canvas even lines up with a number in
          the writing: 1. Right up in the top left corner.

    <observable-title>Chair</observable-title>
    <observable-description>
      You try not to look at the model too much as you give the chair a close
      examination. It’s a deep maroon colour and looks pristinely brand new. No holes, no
      tears, no stains. This must seriously have just been bought. There aren’t any funny
      recesses or anything for you to reach into.

          The juice must have loosened it up, because it doesn’t take much to tear a square
          of fabric away. Yeah, Josquin’s wife is going to mega hate you.

    <observable-title>Copies</observable-title>
    <observable-description>
      What you see are two surprisingly large pieces of paper with long, wordy
      scripts calligraphied on them. You can’t read the language, but the lettering is
      unusual: instead of fancy cursive, each letter is separated from the ones around it
      with more space than you’d normally expect. Maybe that’s just how it was done back
      then? Back… now? Interestingly, the two papers are identical in every way – even
      down to a small stain in the bottom corner. That definitely isn’t a coincidence. You
      believe Josquin must be, along with a regular artist, an expert at copying. You hope
      you aren’t witnessing some centuries-old forgery racket.
    </observable-description>
  </observable>
  <observable>
    <observable-title>Easel</observable-title>
    <observable-description>
      Upon the wooden easel sits a big canvas, the artwork on it partially completed.
      The whole thing has a draft sketch in pencil, and Josquin has been steadily filling
      up sections with paint, starting from the bottom. The sketch depicts the scene in
      front of it: the model posing on the lounge chair. Her facial expression is one of
      distaste, and her hands… hm, they’re bent up towards her face, but it looks like they
      weren’t quite finished, or Josquin erased them a little. Maybe she was meant to be
      holding something but he’d changed his mind about what. Josquin has painted the
      floor just fine, and seems to have stopped just as he was getting to the chair. A bit of
      the paint in this area looks older, like it was painted some days ago, and the colour
      is very striking; the maroon gleams with a magical light of its own. The bit of chair
      with the more recent paint – today’s paint – isn’t quite as good. It’s almost the same
      colour, but it’s missing the vibrancy. That explains the outburst you heard. On the
      very top of the image, still in pencil, is what looks like a working title. You can’t read
      it, of course – you don’t even think you can pronounce the first word. ‘Quisquillosa’?
      Something like that. As you struggle to say it, you hear a small sound of derision
      come from in front of you. The model? You peer around the canvas, and she says in
      accented English, “It means <em>The Fussy Eater Tries.</em>”

          You remove The Fussy Eater from the
          easel, careful to not touch any of the wet paint. There’s nothing on the back of the
          painting, but on the easel itself, you spot a message written into the wood. Problem
          is, it’s naturally written in Spanish.

          She walks around the

          list,” she says critically. “Or a recipe. ‘Ingredients: base, spruce shavings, violet
          flower, and a stained fabric of many fragrances.’ He’s a funny man.”

    <observable-description>
      It’s your idyllic fruit bowl from all those classic beginner painting classes.
      There’s a single apple, banana, pear, orange, cherry and mango. They all look
      excellent and edible, but if they’re supposed to be used for art, maybe you should be
      careful about what you do with them.

          You move some of the larger pieces of fruit
          aside, and sitting in the bottom of the bowl you spy a piece of paper. It’s tiny, just a
          corner scrap, really. Just two letters are written on it, an A and a C, and they can’t
          have been too important because they’ve been crossed out. Not just once, either:
          they’ve been crossed out with five horizontal lines.

        <action-description>
          You
          take a decent bite of the cherry that amounts to about half of its volume. It’s
          delicious. Not only that, it’s super juicy, a huge drip falls down your chin, and
          another goes flying a few feet away – landing right on the chair. Oops. That might
          leave a mark.

          You take bites of the three fruits and allow their juices to pool on a single
          spot on the chair. Anna looks dismayed, but you remind her of the message on the
          easel. She still doesn’t look convinced. You let the juices sit and soak for a minute
          until they’ve left a decent-sized dark, sweet-smelling splotch on the material. Not
          only that, it looks like it’s having a weakening effect on it, making it more prone to
          ripping. Josquin’s wife is going to hate you.

    <observable-description>
      The machine almost resembles a miniature cooking pot. It’s got a little lid
      and everything, which has a long interior attachment on it. It’s made of stone, and
      when you look inside the bowl, it’s basically empty but you do see the faint dried
      remains of coloured powders. This must be a specialised artist’s mortar and pestle.

          grind. You give it a minute, then open the lid back up. Ugh, well, it grinded all right.
          But it looks like ground mush. Nothing like paint. Better scrape that onto the floor
          and start fresh.

          Pigment base first, then small amounts of the wood shavings, a few
          bits of violet flower petal, and of course the small patch of couch that you so
          thoroughly destroyed... you stick them all in. And you close the lid and grind them
          up. You’re not taking any changes; you grind them hard. And when you finally feel
          like whatever’s inside is smooth, you open it up again. And wow. That is the most
          spectacular, radiant maroon paint you’ve ever seen. You feel so proud. You hope
          Josquin sees it before he quits painting forever!

      remember reading that the old classic artists generally ground up their own pigments
      and stored them in glass or… ugh… pig bladders. These are definitely not glass. You
      try to ignore that and look inside. You find red, blue, yellow, black and white. Lots of

          a ‘new colour’ for the paint on the chair, and her complexion didn’t suit it. But then
          his wife went and threw out the chair and replaced it with a new one, because it was
          getting tattered and stained. Cleaning, she said. And she cleaned up other things,
          too, like the key for Josquin’s violin, and a few other pieces. He was <em>furious.</em> Said it

      Josquin to have locked it behind him, right? You give the hatch a test shove. It barely
      moves – definitely blocked off somehow – but something falls through the thin gap
      separating the hatch from the ceiling. It’s a small fragment of art paper, with a few
      words scribbled on it.

          to take a look, and inside you find a small pile of sheet music, along with a precious-
          looking <u>box</u> the size of a large book. It’s locked, and on its lid are nine buttons

          arranged in a square. The first eight have letters of the alphabet written on them (A
          to H), and the final one is blank.

    <observable-description>
      The vase is tall with a very narrow neck, not even wide enough for your hand.
      A single delicate, thin-stemmed red carnation sticks out of it. It’s beautiful, the
      freshest flower you’ve ever seen or smelled. The vase is white porcelain (which you
      believe wasn’t made in Europe until the 1700s or so, giving you a better idea of the
      time period), and it has a rather unusual pattern painted on it.

          vase. This feels like a waste, but the instructions were right there... what could this
          be achieving? Nothing’s happening.

          Okay. This must do something. You watch for a while, and you
          start to notice something. The stem of the carnation is changing colour. It’s like the
          paints are seeping up inside it, crawling their way up to the petals – and when they
          reach them, the petals start changing colour, too. The red is still there, but heavily
          tinged with blue and black, until eventually the whole carnation is a deep, dark violet.
          I mean, it’s still a carnation, just a violet carnation.

    <observable-title>Violin case</observable-title>
    <observable-description>
      You can tell from the size and shape that it’s a violin case, and when
      you pick it up, it’s weighty. It may in fact have a violin inside. If it does, however, it
      must be a very precious violin; Josquin has had the case fitted with a lock requiring
      a key. Not only that, when you flip it over, there’s something inscribed into the
      bottom: <em>A jump of two, a step of one, two jump right here and then be done.</em>

          It unlocks! You’re half expecting

          that. The wooden front piece has several odd scrapes across it, some of them wide
          enough that they’re almost gauges.

      A box the size of a large book. It’s locked, and on its lid are nine buttons arranged

      the final one is blank.

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>
    Josquin said it could ‘finish itself’, right? Surely he won’t mind if you give it a bit of
    help. Using your fingers since you don’t have a brush, you dab just the right amount
    of this beautiful maroon paint along the image of the chair. It matches the old colour
    perfectly. Just as you finish, you hear the hatch flip open and loud footsteps hit the
    stairs. You aren’t sure what to do; you haven’t exactly been covering your tracks in
    here, and you don’t want Anna to get blamed. But her eyes widen, she leaps back
    onto her chair, and motions for you to get behind the table. You don’t stop to ask if
    she’s sure.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you leap under the table, your watch beeps. You quickly silence it, but you believe
    that means your time here is almost up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Josquin arrives in the basement, still looking agitated, and he storms over to his
    easel. His eyes immediately fall onto the painting, and the new addition to it, the
    entire chair coated in that spectacular new shade. His jaw drops. He looks at Anna
    – and sees the splotch on the couch where the colour was created. Some Spanish
    prayers or curses, you can’t tell which, fall from his lips, and he puts a hand on his
    heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last thing you see before vanishing is Anna giving him – and you – a satisfied
    smile.
  </p>
  <p>
    You stagger out of the time machine in Doc Bill’s lab and tell everyone about your
    experience. You notice a couple of them nodding politely; what, like their time travel
    experiences were cooler?
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, at least Doc Bill is interested in what you have to say. “Fascinating,” he utters.
    “An artist on the verge of leaving the profession. This Josquin’s work must end up
    having quite the secret significance in my timeline. I’ll have to look him up later. I
    think we can say with absolute certainty now that Greg isn’t trying to get anyone
    killed – which is good, obviously – but he must want something. Why else would he
    choose to visit the home of an obscure painter? What would he get out of that?”
    He frowns.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I really thought we might find him in this one. We’re getting closer and closer to the
    present with every journey; there aren’t many times left in which he can hide.
    Whatever he wants, we’ll learn it soon.”
  </p>
  <h1>GM'S Explanation</h1>
  <p>
    Let’s start by examining the easel. On it is the unfinished portrait, The Fussy Eater
    Tries. The artist was just starting to paint the chair when he snapped that the colour
    wasn’t what he wanted and stormed out, so you’ll need to help him out with that.
    Only then will he be willing to finish the rest of the painting. To figure out how to
    make this amazing paint colour, you’ll need to have Anna translate a message hidden
    on the easel, which is a list of the ingredients you’ll need to grind together to make
    the pigment.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the ingredients is a violet flower. Interesting, since the only flower in the room
    is red. Let’s look at the vase. It has a funny picture on it that represents different
    amounts of different coloured paints being poured into the lip of the vase; if you pour
    these paints in, their pigments will be absorbed into the flower stem and change the
    carnation’s colour to violet. Well, that’s not quite true – you’ll actually need to add
    twice as much blue as the vase tells you, which you’ll know if you’ve found a hidden
    message in the hatch at the top of the stairs. But once you’ve done that, woo! One
    ingredient down already.
  </p>
  <p>
    Oh, but I hope you looked inside the vase before pouring. Otherwise, this is going to
    be a bit messy, because there’s a key inside. This key belongs to the violin case. Cool.
    Now… you’ve got a violin. One that looks like it’s a little worse for wear. That’s
    because one of the ingredients, spruce shavings, can be attained by using the paint
    scraper on the violin’s front piece.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let’s take a look at the pile of blank canvases, then. There are seven small canvases,
    and each one has a little circle somewhere on it. These canvases happen to be exactly
    the same size as the copies, and if you match the placement of the circles with parts
    of the copies, you’ll find a code of sorts: “1Ch2P3O”. This is a reference to the fruit
    that was going to be used for The Fussy Eater Tries. The poser was supposed to take
    a bite of each fruit – first the cherry, then the pear, then the orange. The draft
    sketches on the canvases illustrate this. Give the model those fruits, or bite into them
    yourself, and you’ll find all the fruits dripping with sweet-smelling but very stain-y
    juices. This is the part of the recipe regarding ‘a stained fabric of many fragrances’.
    Spill these juices onto the couch, and that bit of fabric will be another one of the
    ingredients.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hey, did you see the inscription on the bottom of the violin case? A jump of two, a
    step of one, two jump right here and then be done. This is in reference to the stairs.
    Starting at the bottom, go up two steps, then one more, then have two people (both
    players, or a player and the model) jump on that stair. This will unlock a secret
    compartment containing a locked box, along with a piece of sheet music.
    Your violin skills aren’t amazing, so you should get the model to play it. She’ll
    immediately realise that the music is slightly unfinished. Fortunately she knows the
    notes at the end: F, C, D, then a chord of some sort… what are the notes there again?
    Ah; hopefully you found a scrap of paper in the fruit bowl with the letters A and C
    on it, crossed out five times to resemble a musical stave. Hey, the locked box had
    letters to press to unlock it; press those letters – F, C, D, then the A and C at the
    same time to finish – and the box will pop open. Inside is a jar of pigment mixing
    base. The final ingredient.
  </p>
  <p>
    With all of them in hand, simply put the four of them in the grinding machine, and
    you’ll have the artist’s amazing colour. Of course, he probably won’t see it if you just
    leave it in here. Didn’t he say that the painting could finish itself for all he cared?
    Sounds like a good invitation.
