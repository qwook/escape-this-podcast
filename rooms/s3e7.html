  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>
    Our Patreon donor in this episode is the wonderful Joshua Hunt. Thank you so much for your support!
  </p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Great, just great. You've been walking for what feels like hours in the dark, in a neighbourhood you don't know.
    Your car battery died and your phone is flat, so you've been wandering the road, trying to find somewhere that's
    open so you can get help. Unfortunately you're in a very residential area and none of the houses have lights on –
    either they're not home, very deeply asleep, or unsurprisingly ignoring the stranger wandering their street in the
    dead of night.</p>
  <p>At long last, you find a building with its lights on: a petrol station, called Josh's Gas & Go. Exhausted, you
    stagger in through the automatic doors and look around for an attendant so you can ask to borrow their phone. Or at
    least, get a drink of water. It's a hot night. But you don't see anyone at the counter. You peer around the back,
    and are about to call out when you hear a voice from somewhere behind you, speaking quietly and sinisterly.</p>
  <p>“Everything's in place. Josh'll be sorry for ever planning to blindside us. Now we'll be the ones to fire him!” The
    voice pauses. “Yes, pun intended.”</p>
  <p>The person speaking, you realise, is just outside the doors. They don't seem to realise you're here. To emphasise
    that, they step back inside for a second, flip the light switch off and head back out. They start walking away, and
    you only hear them say one last thing before they're out of earshot: “Kaboom.”</p>
  <p>Oh dear. You don't like the sound of that. You rush to the door, but somehow the employee's locked it so it's not
    automatically opening anymore. You look around, searching for anything that could help you get out. Looking in from
    the door, there are two long aisles in front of you, one with snacks, one with magazines. Off to your right is the
    cashier's <u>counter</u>, which sits behind a wall of bulletproof glass. And off to the left is a Slushee machine. The <u>door</u>
    is glass, so you can see outside, too. There are four petrol <u>pumps</u>, one with a <u>car</u> parked beside it, and another
    with a spill on the ground and a hazard sign in front of it. To one side of all the pumps there's an <u>ice</u> freezer, a
    <u>hose</u>, <u>bucket</u> and window <u>wiper</u>. And of course, there's a big <u>sign</u> out the front, with Josh's name at the very top.
  </p>
  <p>Obviously, you need to get out of here before whatever it is goes 'kaboom'. And Josh probably doesn't deserve to
    have his petrol station blown up just because he tried to fire two clearly unstable employees. And just in case
    that's not enough motivation, this petrol station is wedged between family homes, an animal rescue centre, and an
    orphanage. So if you save this place, you'll be saving them, too.</p>

          It's amazing that the same pump you'd use on bike tyres can fit into a beach ball, but there you go. You
          inflate it fully, and now that it's in its proper state, you can see a message hidden in its colourful
          pattern! It says 1 (1) + 4 (3) - 3 (2) = 2.

          You get to work cleaning some of the muck off the windscreen. Once you've cleaned it, it's still rather tricky
          seeing much inside the car, but one thing you can see is a post-it note sitting on the dashboard, where
          someone might place their ticket after paying for parking. You lean in close to read it. <em>'This car is not
            abandoned! Sorry, my keys just stop working a lot – their battery overheats. Needs to cool down for a
            while.'</em>

          nothing of interest in the front seats, but in the back, there's a ragged pile of clothes. Mostly plain white
          T- shirts.

    <observable-title>Counter</observable-title>
    <observable-description>
      It's entirely behind the bulletproof glass, with only a small slot through which cashier and customer can pass
      money. Your whole hand couldn't fit through, though – which is frustrating, because just beyond this slot you can
      see a folded piece of paper leaning against the cash register, which has the words 'PASSWORDS AND PROCEDURES'
      written on the outside.

          You tap the buttons to open it up, but there’s no money inside. Instead – and this is the dramatic moment –
          you find, looking just like they do in the movies, a bomb. It isn't ticking but there is a flashing red light
          coming from the electronic panel on the front of it. There's also a bright blue button with the word 'DISARM'.

      front of the door.

          Perfect. You've made the right choice. The lollipop fits through the money slot and its sticky goodness sticks
          to the paper completely, so you can drag it back through. And eat the lollipop. You deserve it. After doing
          so, you unfold the paper to read a bit more about these passwords and procedures – there's surprisingly little
          information, but you do learn that the petrol pumps are refilled on Mondays, the cleaning supplies are changed
          monthly, and the security passwords are changed monthly as well, except for the slushee machine, which is
          never changed. Its password is always 'BERRY'.

      It's a free-standing billboard sort of thing, double-sided. The front simply says, 'STOP! HAZARDOUS SPILL ON THE
      GROUND.' The back is a little more complicated: it contains complex cleaning instructions for spills, but the
      instructions vary depending on what type of petrol was spilled. There are options for many kinds of petrol,
      various unleadeds, ethanol, diesel... and all the instructions are very different. Apparently it's not as simple
      as mopping it up.

      come up to about halfway. Better close the door soon. It's pretty cold.

          bizarre; how do they possibly have enough shoe-related content to fill all these pages every week? Well,
          reading this issue's top story, you see how they do it: it's an article called 'Why the ideal foot weight is
          660 grams'. Apparently foot fat/skinny shaming is a thing now.

      The pumps are numbered 1 to 4; the spill is in front of pump 2, and the car is by pump 4. All the pumps have three

      pump 3 has Unleaded 94, 95 and diesel; pump 4 has 95, 96 and 98. Pump 2's labels, unfortunately, have faded and
      can't be read.

          invisible image suddenly revealing itself. It's an image you recognise right away: it's a game of hangman. The
          player has lost, quite badly, it seems: the stick figure is already being hanged, and several letters are in
          the 'incorrect' box: D, E, G, I, L, O, P, R, S, T, U, and Z. The gaps for the correct phrase are there: 6

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>
    There's no timer on this bomb, but if there were, you're pretty sure it would have stopped with one second left on
    it. You've done it. You've saved Josh's Gas & Go. It's not exactly saving the world, sure, but can you imagine where
    the world would be without petrol stations?
  </p>
  <h1>GM's Explanation</h1>
  <p>
    If you want to save this place, and yourself, you'll need to find a way to open the door and get outside. If you
    examine the bulletproof glass, you'll see there's a small gap for the cashier and customer to pass money through,
    and on the counter just beyond it is a piece of paper labelled 'passwords and procedures'. You can't quite reach it
    with a finger, but if you grab a lollipop and licking it to make it sticky, you can poke that through the hole and
    stick it to the paper to pull it out. On the paper, you'll find some information about how often passwords and other
    aspects of the petrol station are changed, as well as the password to turn on the slushee machine.</p>
  <p>
    But that won't get you very far on its own. What you need to do is look outside, at the station's main sign. In
    those blocky, calculator-like numbers, it has three different petrol prices. Slightly odd ones: 573, 344 and 614. Is
    that in cents? And for how much petrol? Weird. That is, unless you do the old calculator trick of turning the
    numbers upside down – then you get the letters HIGHHEELS. This is the name of one of the magazines on the magazine
    stand, so let's take a look. The lead article for this month's edition is rather odd: it's called “How much should
    your foot weigh?” It tells you the ideal weight of a foot is 660 grams.</p>
  <p>
    This relates to a sign on the door that says if the doors aren't opening, place one foot in the centre of the mat.
    Your feet won't do it, but something that weighs exactly 660 grams will. And luckily, the various size cups
    available at the slushee machine can make that weight. The easiest way to make it would be two large slushees and
    two small, but there may be other combinations (for convenience's sake, using snacks from the snack shelf won't
    work. Let's say the snack makers lie about weight a lot). Make these four slushees and stick them in front of the
    door, and it will open!</p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, now that you're outside, you learn that the danger is actually back inside, behind the bulletproof
    glass. However, it's very easy to get back there now: the code to unlock the glass door is written on the bottom of
    the bucket. This was hinted at earlier when players learned that the code and the cleaning supplies get changed at
    the same time, so they have something in common. Inside the cash register on the counter you find a bomb, and to
    defuse it, it prompts you to input a name.</p>
  <p>
    Okay. We need a name. Maybe in the car? The windows are tinted and the windscreen is filthy, so we'll need to clean
    it with the wiper to see inside. On the dashboard is a note apologising for the abandoned car, saying they just need
    to put their keys 'somewhere cold' to get them working again. In the freezer, perhaps? But there's so much ice in
    there, there's no way you can rummage through it to find keys. There is something you can do, though, and it might
    be tricky to figure out. The ice isn't in huge clumps, just regular cubes. It would float pretty easily. Keys, on
    the other hand, would not. If you take the hose and fill the freezer with water, it'll be much easier to feel around
    for the keys at the bottom. Now you can unlock the car. Nothing inside, but there is a bicycle pump in the boot.
    Inflating the beach ball you found in the bucket earlier using the pump will reveal a mathsy-looking equation: 1 (1)
    + 4 (3) – 3 (2) = 2.</p>
  <p>
    This may have something to do with the four pumps, especially since you don't know what petrol has spilled from Pump
    2 onto the ground. If you add the numbers from the first petrol at Pump 1 and the second at Pump 4, and subtract the
    third from Pump 3, you'll get your mystery Pump 2 petrol. Now you can follow the instructions for clearing the spill
    (you may need the bucket and icy cold water that you hosed into the freezer). The final step will involve soaking it
    up with the clothes from the back seat of the car, and when you do that, a hidden image will reveal itself on the
    front of one of the shirts. It's a hangman game, with several letters already attempted and the game lost. Those
    letters happen to very closely match those on the hazard sign... only, missing a few. And if you figure out which
    letters are missing – HAANHN – you can rearrange them to make a very common name: Hannah. That bomb's got nothing on
    your skills.</p>
